# Infosys Raccoon Detector
I spent 10 weeks in Bangalore, India in Summer of 2018 as part of a global internship with Infosys InStep. Originally, I was assigned a Bayesian statistics project in R, but after Week 3, I successfully switched to a Computer Vision project in Python, because I wanted to explore this field since I had no prior experience in it and had too much in Bayesian statistics. I did not want to rabbit-hole myself into Statistics, and instead wanted to expand my breadth, and not depth of knowledge. Although a bit out of my comfort zone, I was determined to learn as much as I could about computer vision.

## Content
Since I was new to computer vision, I heavily followed online tutorials. I have included a Jupyter notebook, two supplementary Python codes, and my final powerpoint presentation with short demos that serve to demonstrate what I accomplished during the summer. In order to view the side-by-side video demos of the raccoons, the .pptx file is included for download, since .pdf is unfortunately static.

I would like to give my due respect and acknowledgements to the following online tutorials that I followed:
